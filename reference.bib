	abstract = {With the booming demand of indoor position information, Wireless signals (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ultra-Wide-Band etc.) are investigated to construct Indoor Positioning System ({IPS}). Among these wireless signals, {UWB} (Ultra-Wide-Band) is recognized as the most promising technology to construct {IPS} with decimeter-level positioning accuracy. However, there are various objects in indoor environments, {UWB} signals might be reﬂected by these surrounding objects. These None-Line-Of-Sight ({NLOS}) signals will induce additional errors to the distance measurements between the anchor and agent. Therefore, {NLOS}/{LOS} (Line-Of-Sight) signals classiﬁcation should be carried out for identifying the {NLOS} reception. In {UWB} based {IPS}, the distance information is extracted through the Channel Impulse Response ({CIR}) waveforms. {NLOS} reception will lead to different {CIR} waveforms compared with that from the {LOS} signal, this difference could be characterized for {NLOS}/{LOS} signals classiﬁcation. However, the hardware circuits, signal transmitting path and the {NLOS} reception will bring about noises to the {CIR} waveforms, which might inﬂuence the signal type identiﬁcation. Motivated by this problem, in this letter, a reversible transformation method was proposed for de-nosing the {CIR} data, and a Conventional Neural Network ({CNN}) was employed to identify the {NLOS} signal. Raw and de-noised {CIR} dataset were both input to the {CNN} for assessing the effect of the de-noising method. With dataset collected from seven different sites, the results showed that the reversible transformation method was able to increase the Signal Noise Ratio ({SNR}) values of these {CIR} datasets. After the de-noising, the {CNN} performed higher classiﬁcation accuracy with less convolutional layers. Moreover, the de-noising operation brought about higher {NLOS} signal identiﬁcation accuracy increase than that of {LOS} signals.},

	abstract = {Non-Line-of-Sight ({NLoS}) propagation condition is a crucial factor affecting the precision of the localization in the Ultra-Wideband ({UWB}) Indoor Positioning System ({IPS}). Numerous supervised Machine Learning ({ML}) approaches have been applied for {NLoS} identification to improve the accuracy of the {IPS}. However, it is difficult for existing {ML} approaches to maintain a high classification accuracy when the database contains a small number of {NLoS} signals and a large number of Line-of-Sight ({LoS}) signals. The inaccurate localization of the target node caused by this small number of {NLoS} signals can still be problematic. To solve this issue, we propose feature-based Gaussian Distribution ({GD}) and Generalized Gaussian Distribution ({GGD}) {NLoS} detection algorithms. By employing our detection algorithm for the imbalanced dataset, a classification accuracy of \$96.7{\textbackslash}\%\$ and \$98.0{\textbackslash}\%\$ can be achieved. We also compared the proposed algorithm with the existing cutting-edge such as Support-Vector-Machine ({SVM}), Decision Tree ({DT}), Naive Bayes ({NB}), and Neural Network ({NN}), which can achieve an accuracy of \$92.6{\textbackslash}\%\$, \$92.8{\textbackslash}\%\$, \$93.2{\textbackslash}\%\$, and \$95.5{\textbackslash}\%\$, respectively. The results demonstrate that the {GGD} algorithm can achieve high classification accuracy with the imbalanced dataset. Finally, the proposed algorithm can also achieve a higher classification accuracy for different ratios of {LoS} and {NLoS} signals which proves the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed method.},
